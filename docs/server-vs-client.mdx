Generally web3 is thought of as a client side platform. However most contracts have a few admin features that admins can perform. This is really useful for a variety of contracts (especially when you're starting out).

Breaking down how we differentiate between **client** vs **admin**:

## Client

The client side SDKs provide interfaces to work with a users wallet. There are functions available for every role: admin, minter, pauser, transfer and user (no role).

## Admin (Server)

admin SDKs make it easy for you perform admin actions. This gives you a variety of abilities including: access control management, minting, listing, pausing and transferring.
