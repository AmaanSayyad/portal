_The **admin dashboard** allows anyone to easily deploy and manage their own smart contracts (modules)._

We automatically set up all the necessary infrastructure for you to ensure that you can rely on our scalable and performant system. We provide **secure user authentication**, **on-chain wallets**, **on-chain data indexing**, and an exposed API out of the box for your ease of use.

We also provide a simple interface to create and sell packs and rewards directly through the dashboard.

## Set up

- Go to the Admin UI: [thirdweb.com/start](https://thirdweb.com/start)
- Connect your wallet (on the chain you want)
- Create an [Application](/portal/docs/overview)
- Create the [Contracts](/portal/docs/overview) you want to use

### Key Components

The admin dashboard serves to be the main interface for a few key features that allow for ease of use of pack protocol. The dashboard allows you to do the following:

- **Deploy & Fund Contracts**: Easily deploy your own instances of the pack protocol contracts on Ethereum-based chains as well as maintain and fund them to keep them functional.
- **Interact With Contracts**: Interact with your contracts directly through our dashboard to create and sell packs and rewards.
