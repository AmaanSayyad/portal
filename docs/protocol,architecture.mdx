The **thirdweb** protocol is centered around a single `Registry` smart contract. You interact with this `Registry` contract when you create an application on [thirdweb.com/start](https://thirdweb.com/start)

Each 'application' is a smart contract that allows you to track and configure n number of any of the protocol's 4 main components - **Token**, **NFT Collection**, **Pack** and **Market** - for that application.

The `application` smart contract can also manage components that don't fit the structure of the protocol's 4 main components. This lets you add, track and configure custom smart contracts using the `application` smart contract.
