## Getting Started

The pack interface allows anyone to fetch the public metadata about any of the on-chain packs, and it allows users to check their pack ownership, transfer packs to others, and most importantly to open packs.

To initialize the SDKs pack interface, you can pass in the relevant smart contract address by following the code below.

```js
// Get pack contract address from admin dashboard
const address = "0x...";

const sdk = new ThirdwebSDK(...)

// Initialize pack SDK by passing in contract address
const pack = await sdk.getPackModule(address);
```

## Interfaces

```ts
interface NFTMetadata {
  id: string;
  uri: string;
  name?: string; // optional
  description?: string; // optional
  image?: string; // optional
  properties?: Record<string, JSONValue>; // optional
}

interface PackMetadata {
  id: string;
  creator: string;
  currentSupply: BigNumber;
  openStart: Date | null;
  openEnd: Date | null;
  metadata: NFTMetadata;
}

interface PackNFTMetadata {
  supply: BigNumber;
  metadata: NFTMetadata;
}
```

## Functions

### open

`open(packId: string): Promise<PackNFTMetadata>`

Open a pack to get one of the bundle NFTs within it and get the metadata of the returned NFT.

```js
// the packId of the pack you want to open
const packId = "42";

// returns the metadata of the nft received from pack
const metadata = await pack.open(packId);

// all nft metadata is now available
const { name, description, image, supply } = metadata;
```

### get

`get(packId: string): Promise<PackMetadata>`

Gets the metadata of a specific on-chain pack including its name, description, and image.

```js
// the packId of the pack you want to open
const packId = "42";

// returns the metadata of the nft received from pack
const metadata = await pack.get(packId);

// metadata is now directly available
const { name, description, image } = metadata;
```

### getAll

`getAll(): Promise<PackMetadata[]>`

Get the metadata of all on-chain Packs.

```js
// returns list of nft metadata of all on-chain nfts
const packs = await pack.getAll();

packs.map((metadata) => {
  // pack metadata is directly available off each item
  const { name, description, image } = metadata;
});
```

### getNFTs

`getNFTs(packId: string): Promise<PackNFTMetadata[]>`

Gets the NFT metadata of the NFTs contained within a specific pack along with the NFT supplies.

```js
// the packId of the pack you want to open
const packId = "42";

// gets metadata of nfts bundled within pack
const nfts = await pack.getNFTs(packId);

nfts.map((metadata) => {
  // nft metadata is directly available off each item
  const { name, description, image } = metadata;
});
```

### balance

`balance(tokenId: string): Promise<BigNumber>`

Get the pack balance of the user currently connected to the SDK for a specific pack.

```js
// the tokenId of the pack that you want to fetch
const tokenId = "42";

// get the pack balance of the account currently connected
const balance = await pack.balance(tokenId);
```

### balanceOf

`balanceOf(address: string, tokenId: string): Promise<BigNumber>`

Get the pack balance of a user specified by their public address for a specific pack.

```js
// the tokenId of the pack that you want to fetch
const tokenId = "42";

// the address of the user you want to fetch the balance of
const address = "0x...";

// get the pack balance of the specified account
const balance = await pack.balanceOf(address, tokenId);
```

### transfer

`transfer(to: string, tokenId: string, quantity: BigNumber): Promise<void>`

Transfer a specific pack from the user connected to the SDK to another user by specifying their address.

```js
// the packId of the nft that you want to send
const tokenId = "42";

// the address of the user you want to transfer the nft to
const to = "0x...";

// wait for transfer transaction to complete
await pack.transfer(to, tokenId);
```
