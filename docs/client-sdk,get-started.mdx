## Getting Started

```bash
npm install @3rdweb/sdk ethers
```

## Basic Usage

Once you have the SDK you can use it in your project by following the structure of the code below:

```js
const { ThirdwebSDK } = require("@3rdweb/sdk");
const { ethers } = require("ethers");
// The wallet that will be making the sdk contract calls, read more below
//const rpcUrl = 'https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com';
const rpcUrl = "https://polygon-rpc.com";
// Read Only Provider
const providerOrSigner = ethers.Wallet.createRandom().connect(rpcUrl);
// Initialize SDK instance
const sdk = new ThirdwebSDK(providerOrSigner);
```

The `providerOrSigner` variable gives you the freedom to configure authentication and wallets in whatever structure you would like. We suggest using [`ethersjs`](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) to setup the provider.

After this setup, you should have a working SDK instance to interact with contracts. Proceed to the following sections to learn more about different Modules.
