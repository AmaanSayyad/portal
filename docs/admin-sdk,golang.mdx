The Golang SDK provides you with all the methods you need to interact with the protocols.

## Getting Started

```bash
go get github.com/nftlabs/nftlabs-sdk-go
```

## Instantiating the SDK

The Go SDK can be used with or without a private key.
If you provide a private key, it'll be used to sign all transactions that mutate on-chain state.
In the below example, we're providing the private key through the `PKEY` environment variable.

```python
client, err := ethclient.Dial("https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com")
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}

var nftlabsSdk nftlabs.ISdk
if sdk, err := nftlabs.NewSdk(client, &nftlabs.SdkOptions{
	PrivateKey: os.Getenv("PKEY"),
}); err != nil {
	panic(err)
} else {
	nftlabsSdk = sdk
}
```
