The protocol has 4 main components: **Token**, **NFT Collection**, **Pack** and **Market**. Each of these components can work as standalones, but they're designed to work together, smoothly. You can build powerful products using two or more of these together.

- **Token**: your own currency.
- **NFT Collection**: 1 of 1 unique items, or limited supply items of a kind.
- **Pack**: packs filled with items, which can be opened to retrieve an item(s) within.
- **Market**: a market to buy and sell packs and NFTs.

The protocol lets you create n number of 'applications'. Each application is a manager smart contract that tracks and lets you configure each of your components, for that application. As seen in [thirdweb.com/dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard).

The protocol lets you create n number of each of the components - **Token**, **NFT Collection**, **Pack** and **Market** - under each application.

Both **Token** and **NFT Collection** implement popular token standards and give you full control over the mechanics of your currencies and NFTs.

The **Pack** component provides a flexible 'lootbox' API. Packs can contain arbitrary crypto assets as items - exclusive NFTs to ERC 20 tokens. A pack can be opened in exchange for one or more of the packed items. The chance of receiving a particular item depends on how rare the item is.

Both packs and NFTs of any kind can be airdropped to an audience, or sold on the **Market**. A fixed percentage of pack and reward sales/resales is distributed as royalties to the creator of those tokens, and to the protocol, as marketplace fees.
