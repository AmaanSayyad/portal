## Getting Started

The currency interface allows anyone to fetch the public metadata about any of the on-chain currency and transfer currency to others.

To initialize the SDKs currency interface, you can pass in the relevant smart contract address by following the code below.

```js
// Get contract address from admin dashboard
const address = "0x...";

const sdk = new ThirdwebSDK(...)

// Initialize pack SDK by passing in contract address
const currency = await sdk.getTokenModule(address);
```

## Interfaces

```ts
interface Currency {
  name: string;
  symbol: string;
  decimals: number;
}

interface CurrencyValue {
  name: string;
  symbol: string;
  decimals: number;
  value: string;
  displayValue: string;
}
```

## Functions

### get

`get(): Promise<Currency>`

Gets the metadata of the on-chain currency specified by the initialized coin SDK interface.

```js
// get the currency currently connected to the coin interface
const currency = await currency.get();

// now all the currency metadata is available
const { name, symbol, decimals } = currency;
```

### getValue

`getValue(value: BigNumberish): Promise<CurrencyValue>`

Get the currency value of a quantity of coins.

```js
// get the value of 10 coins
const currencyValue = await currency.getValue(10);

// value data is directly available
const { value, displayValue } = currencyValue;
```

### balance

`balance(): Promise<CurrencyValue>`

Get the coin balance of the user currently connected to the SDK.

```js
// get the coin balance of the connected user
const balance = await currency.balance();

// value data is directly available
const { value, displayValue } = balance;
```

### balanceOf

`balanceOf(address: string, tokenId: string): Promise<CurrencyValue>`

Get the coin balance of a user specified by their public address.

```js
// the address of the user you want to fetch the balance of
const address = "0x...";

// get the coin balance of the specified account
const balance = await currency.balanceOf(address);

// value data is directly available
const { value, displayValue } = balance;
```

### transfer

`transfer(to: string, amount: BigNumber): Promise<void>`

Transfer a certain amount of coins from the connected user to a user specified by their address.

```js
// the address of the user you want to transfer
const to = "0x...";

// how many coins you want to transfer parseUnits(amount, decimals)
const amount = ethers.utils.parseUnits(1, 18);

// wait for transfer to complete
await currency.transfer(to, amount);
```
