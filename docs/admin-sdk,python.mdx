The Python SDK is a package you can use to call the protocol methods from a Python application.

## Getting Started

```bash
pip install nftlabs-sdk
```

## Instantiating the SDK

The Python SDK can be used with or without a private key.
If you provide a private key, it'll be used to sign all transactions that mutate on-chain state.
In the below example, we're providing the private key through the PKEY environment variable.

```python
import os
from nftlabs import NftlabsSdk, SdkOptions
# do not share PKEY
options = SdkOptions(private_key=os.getenv("PKEY"))
sdk = NftlabsSdk(options, "https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com")
```
