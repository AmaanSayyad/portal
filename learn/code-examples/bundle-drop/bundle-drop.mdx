### Deploy a Bundle Drop

- Import `readFileSync` at the top of your file if you want to add an image for your bundle.
- Import `ethers` if you want to make your bundle drop free.

```ts
import { readFileSync } from "fs";
import { ethers } from "ethers";
```

```ts
const app = sdk.getAppModule("<APP_MODULE_ADDRESS>");

const deployBundleDrop = async () => {
  try {
    const bundleDrop = await app.deployBundleDropModule({
      // The collection's name, ex. CryptoPunks
      name: "NarutoDAO Membership",
      // A description for the collection.
      description: "A DAO for fans of Naruto.",
      // The image that will be held on our NFT! The fun part :).
      image: readFileSync("scripts/assets/naruto.png"),
      // We need to pass in the address of the person who will be receiving the proceeds from sales of nfts in the module.
      // We're planning on not charging people for the drop, so we'll pass in the 0x0 address
      // you can set this to your own wallet address if you want to charge for the drop.
      primarySaleRecipientAddress: ethers.constants.AddressZero,
    });

    console.log(
      "✅ Successfully deployed bundleDrop module, address:",
      bundleDrop.address,
    );
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("failed to deploy bundleDrop module", error);
  }
};

deployBundleDrop();
```

### Configure the bundle drop

Remember to import `readFileSync` at the top of your file:

```ts
import { readFileSync } from "fs";
```

```ts
const bundleDrop = sdk.getBundleDropModule("<DROP_MODULE_ADDRESS>");

const configBundleDrop = async () => {
  try {
    await bundleDrop.createBatch([
      {
        name: "Leaf Village Headband",
        description: "This NFT will give you access to NarutoDAO!",
        image: readFileSync("scripts/assets/headband.png"),
      },
    ]);
    console.log("✅ Successfully created a new NFT in the drop!");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("failed to create the new NFT", error);
  }
};

configBundleDrop();
```

### Setting Claim Conditions

```ts
    const bundleDrop = sdk.getBundleDrop("<MODULE_ADDRESS>");

    const setClaimCondition = async () => {
      const allowList = [
        "<ALLOWED_ADDRESS_1>",
        "<ALLOWED_ADDRESS_2>",
        "<ALLOWED_ADDRESS_3>",
        "<ALLOWED_ADDRESS_4>",
      ];
      const factory = bundleDrop.getClaimConditionFactory();
      const claimPhase = factory.newClaimPhase({
        startTime: new Date(),
        maxQuantity: 10,
        maxQuantityPerTransaction: 1,
      });
      claimPhase.setPrice(
        // price cannot be set above, use this way instead
        1,
        "<TOKEN_ADDRESS>",
      ); // optional, can be left blank for native currency
      claimPhase.setWaitTimeBetweenClaims(24 * 60 * 60);
      claimPhase.setSnapshot(allowList);
      await bundleDrop.setClaimCondition("0", factory); // 0 refers to token id
    };
```

### Snapshot Condition

Bundle drops are a special type of drop that allows you to create a collection (ERC-1155)
of NFTs. That means that each token you mint gets its own ID, and in turn its
own set of claim conditions.

In this case, you'll notice on the last line that we pass the argument `"0"`, which
applies the claim conditions for that specific token ID.

```js
const factory = bundleDropModule.getClaimConditionFactory();
const phase = factory.newClaimPhase({
  startTime: new Date(),
});
await phase.setSnapshot(["<ALLOWED_ADDRESS_1>", "<ALLOWED_ADDRESS_2>", ...]);
await bundleDropModule.setClaimCondition("0", factory);
```
